## Desired Contributions

Below is a short list of the areas we are looking for contributions:
- Further verification and tests to ensure that the simulator results are as expected, for example, testcases that include various combinations of LEGv8 instructions.
- Further improvements to the UI, especially in the pipelined CPU and 'bubble' visusalisation. 
- Visual display for data memory.
- Further enhancement of documentation or correct any errors/provide improvements.
- Exceptions and cache support.
