Welcome to our LEGv8 ISA Simulator (BETA version)!

### [Download the simulator here](https://github.com/arm-university/LEGv8-ISA-Simulator/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

LEGv8 ISA Simulator is a web browser-based simulator for a subset of the Armv8-A instructions (known as LEGv8). This simulator can be run locally on a PC, and is offered exclusively and at no cost to academics, teaching staff, and learners worldwide. 

**Note: This tool is currently a BETA version.**

 
 ## Kit features

* Cross-platform, no installation required.
* Contains a code editor, with a visible and interactive register file.
* Shows visual datapaths similar to those in the **Computer Organization and Design (Arm Edition**) textbook by David A. Patterson, John L, Hennessy. 
* Execution mode:
    * Has ability to step through execution of instructions.
    * Provides expected results (register contents, flags).
    * Contains single-cycle CPU and pipelined CPU view.
    * Highlights datapaths of the CPU that uses a specific instruction. 
* Documentation provided.
* **Prerequisites:** Basics of assembly programming.

## Purpose of the Simulator
To produce learners who can program using Arm instructions and describe the corresponding datapaths involved in a single-cycle or a pipelined CPU. The simulator also provide error messages/feedback for learning purposes. 

**This tool is currently a BETA version, so please contact us at education@arm.com with feedback, comments, or issues about this tool.**

## Inclusive Language Commitment
Arm is committed to making the language we use inclusive, meaningful, and respectful. Our goal is to remove and replace non-inclusive language from our vocabulary to reflect our values and represent our global ecosystem.
 
Arm is working actively with our partners, standards bodies, and the wider ecosystem to adopt a consistent approach to the use of inclusive language and to eradicate and replace offensive terms. We recognise that this will take time. This course may contain references to non-inclusive language; it will be updated with newer terms as those terms are agreed and ratified with the wider community. We recognise that some of you will be accustomed to using the previous terms and may not immediately recognise their replacements. Please refer to the following example:

* When introducing the architecture, we will use the term ‘Requester’ instead of ‘Master’ and ‘Completer’ instead of ‘Slave’. 

 
Contact us at education@arm.com with questions or comments about this tool. You can also report non-inclusive and offensive terminology usage in Arm content at terms@arm.com.
